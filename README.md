This is a repository that I used, briefly, while I was figuring out how to
implement the [Unicode Collation Algorithm](https://unicode.org/reports/tr10/)
in Rust.

My work has since moved to the following repositories:

- [feruca](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/feruca)
- [feruca-mapper](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/feruca-mapper)
- [feruca-benchmarks](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/feruca-benchmarks)
